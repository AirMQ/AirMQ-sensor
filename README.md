# AirMQ-sensor
Root repository for AirMQ hardware project

AirMQ toolkit consists of main MCU and several sensor boards designed with common form factor in mind. Currently, dust, radiation and electrochemical sensor boards are available. 
MCU board includes advanced power circuitry which makes possible the use of reduced consumption modes while powering from batteries or solar panels. All ESP8266â€™s gpio pins are accessible with a separate 16-pin connector sharing pin numbering with most popular development boards. 
All boards share the same type of extension connector which allows for stackability limited by sensors size.
